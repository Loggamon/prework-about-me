      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Logan, and I am 27 years old.
        I am a proud father of five, and I work as a barista at Starbucks.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Vicenza, Italy, but I have lived most of my life in Seattle, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>A few of my favorite hobbies include; playing video games, playing/composing music, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to find a position in game-design!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Seattle, Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Coding is language that I've always been fascinated with. When I was younger, my friend and I would get together and design games for each other to play.
         At the time, the coding software we used to make the games was slimmed down for consumption, but the concept of being able to interact with the figurative 
         DNA of a website or a piece of software fascinated me. Learning Web Design, I believe, is the chance for me to learn the builing blocks and hone my own craft.</p>
